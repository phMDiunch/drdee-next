# Treatment Care Feature Refactoring - Complete

## Overview

Successfully refactored the treatment-care feature to align with the consistent naming conventions and structure used by other features (customers, payments, etc.).

## Changes Completed

### 1. File Structure & Organization

- ✅ Created missing `src/features/treatment-care/pages/` folder
- ✅ Added `TreatmentCareListPage.tsx` following feature patterns
- ✅ Created index files for better imports organization

### 2. Component Renaming

- ✅ `CandidatesTable.tsx` → `TreatmentCareCustomerTable.tsx`
- ✅ `RecordsList.tsx` → `TreatmentCareRecordTable.tsx` → `TreatmentCareTable.tsx`
- ✅ `CreateCareModal.tsx` → `TreatmentCareModal.tsx`
- ✅ `CareDetailDrawer.tsx` → `TreatmentCareDetailDrawer.tsx` → `TreatmentCareDetail.tsx`
- ❌ `CustomerTreatmentCareTab.tsx` → **REMOVED** (replaced with TreatmentCareTable for consistency)

### 3. Hook Renaming & Updates

- ✅ `useCandidates.ts` → `useTreatmentCareCustomers.ts`
  - `useAftercareCandidates` → `useTreatmentCareCustomers`
- ✅ `useTreatmentCares.ts` → `useTreatmentCareRecords.ts`
  - `useTreatmentCares` → `useTreatmentCareRecords`
  - `useCreateTreatmentCare` → `useCreateTreatmentCareRecord`
  - `useDeleteTreatmentCare` → `useDeleteTreatmentCareRecord`
  - `useCustomerTreatmentCares` → `useCustomerTreatmentCareRecords`

### 4. Type Definitions Updates

- ✅ `CandidateItem` → `TreatmentCareCustomer`
- ✅ `GroupedByDay` → `TreatmentCareGroupedByDay`
- ✅ Updated all type imports and usage

### 5. API Integration

- ✅ Updated query keys for consistency
- ✅ Fixed all API endpoint references
- ✅ Updated cache invalidation calls

### 6. Application Route Updates

- ✅ Updated `src/app/(private)/treatment-care/page.tsx` to use new components
- ✅ Fixed all import statements across the codebase

### 7. Code Quality Improvements

- ✅ Added proper TypeScript types to eliminate 'any' type usage
- ✅ Updated function and component names for consistency
- ✅ Fixed all import/export statements

## Feature Structure (After Final Refactoring)

```
src/features/treatment-care/
├── components/
│   ├── TreatmentCareCustomerTable.tsx     # Customer candidates table
│   ├── TreatmentCareTable.tsx             # Main records table (renamed from TreatmentCareRecordTable)
│   ├── TreatmentCareModal.tsx             # Create/Edit modal
│   ├── TreatmentCareDetail.tsx            # Detail view (renamed from TreatmentCareDetailDrawer)
│   └── index.ts                           # Component exports
├── hooks/
│   ├── useTreatmentCareCustomers.ts       # Hooks for customer candidates
│   ├── useTreatmentCareRecords.ts         # Hooks for care records
│   └── index.ts                           # Hook exports
├── pages/
│   ├── TreatmentCareListPage.tsx          # Main feature page
│   └── index.ts                           # Page exports
├── constants.ts                           # Status options and constants
└── type.ts                                # TypeScript type definitions
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency**: Now follows the same naming pattern as other features (CustomerTable, PaymentVoucherTable, etc.)
2. **Clarity**: `TreatmentCareCustomer` is clearer than `CandidateItem`
3. **Structure**: Complete pages/ folder structure like other features
4. **Maintainability**: Consistent naming makes the codebase easier to navigate
5. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript usage throughout
6. **UI Uniformity**: Removed Timeline UI in favor of consistent Table pattern across all features
7. **Code Reusability**: Single TreatmentCareTable component serves both standalone page and customer detail view

## Validation

- ✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ✅ All import statements updated correctly
- ✅ Component functionality preserved
- ✅ API integrations working correctly
- ✅ Consistent with other feature patterns in the codebase

The treatment-care feature now follows the established patterns and naming conventions used throughout the application.
